The Document foundation today just released the new version of LibreOffice 5.1 for all supported platform (Windows, Linux, OS X). From their changes log there are tons of changes on this release, and it makes me very eager to update my installation. Just to make sure you are keeping track with the open source office suite saga, LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.org which now under maintenance of Document Foundation.

## LibreOffice 5.1 feature changes in highlight

User Interface : There are big reorganization of ui element for Style (Writer), Sheet (Calc) and Slide (Impress and Draw). In addition, several icons and menu commands have been repositioned based on user preferences. What I love from this reorganization is that there are no overall ui changes, so I'm still familiar with the interface but it better access to what functionality I really need.

Interoperability : This part always interesting, every release LibreOffice bring more improvement to this are. In case you are in need, this release bring new filter for Apple Keynote 6, Microsoft Write and Gnumeric files.<!-- more -->

Cloud Storage Integration : Now we can open Sharepoint, Google Drive and Alfresco right from the open file dialog. However I got issue when trying connecting my Google Drive account, it said invalid device or something.

Some Quote from the release note :

```
“LibreOffice 5.1 is another step forward to fulfilling our vision of an office suite tailored on user needs and preferences”, says Bjoern Michaelsen, a Director at The Document Foundation (TDF) and a leading LibreOffice developer. “Since 2010, we have gone through different development cycles to clean up the code and make it more responsive. We are now at a stage where we are close to providing a better user interface.”

“LibreOffice’s third development cycle is leading us to a new user interface concept, where the user will be able to choose the best layout of the elements on the screen for his own needs, to leverage desktop space in the best way” adds Jan Holesovsky, a Director at TDF, and a member of the design team.
