Windows phone apps development ecosystem is not as large as android nor iOS, this fact bring some dilemma for apps developer. It gives big opportunity for new player to get traction from shallower competition, however the small user base is not good news in the other place.
Developing windows phone apps is easier for developers, Microsoft provides good amount of first class tools and documentation. Started from visual studio, smart and easy remote debugging until complete SDK and documentation on msdn.
Just like android with java, the first class citizen on Windows Phone is C#. Its managed nature and a lot of developers familiar with it should be the advantage, combined with xaml it presents unlimited creativity.

This article would be my first series on windows phone app development, see you at next article.
