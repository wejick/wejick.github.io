One of my favorit linux distribution is Linux Mint, it always looks pretty and neat. Honestly I never be its active user but friends of me use it on daily basis, so I can tell that they are happy users.

## Linux Mint got Ars-ed

Recently Arstechnica [reviewed ](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/12/review-mint-17-3-may-be-the-best-linux-desktop-distro/)their latest release (17.3) and it's pretty awesome, Ars called it as best Linux desktop distro yet. Actually I don't really think Arstechnica is good source of opensource software review but that's the main thing, it represents how normal user will think about linux desktop.
